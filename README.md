# Ababu
this is implementation of Robot arm Dynamics.
compute serial link robot joint torque.
Trajectory planing.
Jacobian of n-DOF robot arm.
I only shared paritial starter code for those struggling to figure out dyanmics of robot arm to the public
I have implemented impedance control  as a demo case. But becarfule the physical-parameters of your robot are diffrent from the robot i used/ change it to yours.
This class can be used in real time but i belive there is still much sliming work to avoid watchdog
